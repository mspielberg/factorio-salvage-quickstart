sqs-intro-msg=You were surveying the asteroid belt of this system when a freak collision crippled your spacecraft. You managed to make it to an escape pod as your ship broke up around you, and have landed in one piece on the surface of this Earthlike world. But you aren't safe yet.\n\nThe wreckage will likely land nearby, so watch your head! If you make it through the aftermath unscathed, salvaging the wreckage will make your survival much easier. The larger pieces will likely be too difficult to break down by hand, but explosives should take care of them.
